# Machine Learning Laboratories Repository

Welcome to the repository for the machine learning laboratories from my course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. This repository is designed to save and share the code developed during these labs, covering both classification and regression exercises.
Contents

### This repository includes the following:

    Classification Exercises:

        Exercise 1: [Brief description of the first classification exercise, e.g., "Binary classification using logistic regression."]

        Exercise 2: [Brief description of the second classification exercise, e.g., "Multi-class classification using decision trees."]

    Regression Exercises:

        Exercise 1: [Brief description of the first regression exercise, e.g., "Linear regression for predicting housing prices."]

        Exercise 2: [Brief description of the second regression exercise, e.g., "Polynomial regression for modeling complex relationships."]

## Purpose

### The goal of this repository is to:

    Provide a centralized location for storing and sharing laboratory code.

    Facilitate collaboration and learning by sharing insights and methodologies.

    Serve as a reference for future projects or studies in machine learning.
